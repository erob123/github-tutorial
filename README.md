# github-tutorial_v2
Repository for github tutorial

This is a practice repository for the git & guthub workshop.  If you are planning to attend, please have the following before you arrive:
<ol>
  <li>Read Ch 1-3 of the git book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection</li>
  <li>Install git (see section 1.5 of the first bullet) or visit https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03#file-linux-md</li>
  <li>Bring your favorite text editor.  Planning on doing some JS examples, so if you already have a favorite JS editor, just use that.  Otherwise, I like Notepad++, free download, general purpose.</li>
  <li>Get a github account and send me your username in a slack PM.</li>
</ol>
